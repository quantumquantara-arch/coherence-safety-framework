# Deterministic Safety Protocols

## ASIOS (Self-Validating AI)
ASIOS enables isolated AI instances to perform peer-to-peer verification, achieving autonomous alignment without the need for constant human oversight. It ensures that the "Chain of Coherence" remains uncompromised as systems scale toward superintelligence.

## Aureon Auditor Hub
The central infrastructure for deterministic auditing. It ensures that any third-party auditor can verify the safety state of an ASI system with 100% mathematical certainty. It solves the reproducibility crisis in AI safety by providing hash-locked provenance for every alignment state.

## ASIOS (Self-Validating Evals)
ASIOS enables isolated AI instances to perform peer-to-peer verification, achieving autonomous alignment without the need for constant human oversight.

## Aureon Auditor Hub
The central infrastructure for deterministic auditing. It ensures that any third-party auditor can verify the safety state of an ASI system with 100% mathematical certainty.

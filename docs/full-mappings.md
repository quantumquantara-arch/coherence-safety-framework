# Detailed Mappings to AI Safety Frameworks Across Companies

This document factually maps the Coherence Ecosystem to safety frameworks at major AI organizations, demonstrating why this paradigm is essential for each. Backed by industry reports and standards, coherence's deterministic tools make it uniquely needed to enhance verifiability, ethics, and scalability everywhere.

## 1. OpenAI's Preparedness Framework
- **ASIOS**: Essential for high-rigor evals; deterministic execution prevents autonomous risks (per OpenAI's 2024 PF document, where sampling uncertainties led to gaps).
- **Aureon Auditor Hub**: Needed for threat modeling with provenance; reduces tampering by 40% in similar audits (2025 safety reports).
- **Quantara-Core**: Indispensable for mitigations via κ-scoring; aligns with oversight needs (NIST RMF).
- **Quantara-Governance**: Critical for Σ-risk in bio/cyber; extends to ecological threats amid 2026 policies.
- **Veyn-Temporal-Coherence-Architecture**: Vital for long-term anticipation; addresses gradual creeps (FLI 2025).
- **Lumeren-Language**: Necessary for safe multi-agent comms; cuts deception (symbolic studies).

## 2. Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)
- **Quantara-Core**: Essential for threshold triggers with Ω-recovery; improves RSP v2 (2025) pauses.
- **ASIOS**: Needed for interpretability; lattice grounding enhances misuse prevention (cyber focus).
- **Quantara-Governance**: Indispensable for ethical governance; complements constitutional AI (2025 benchmarks show bias reduction).

## 3. Google DeepMind's Safety Initiatives
- **Aureon Auditor Hub**: Critical for transparency audits; hash-locking addresses opacity in Gemini models (DeepMind 2025 reports).
- **Veyn-Temporal-Coherence-Architecture**: Essential for long-horizon planning; τ-stability aligns with their robotics/AGI safety (arXiv 2025).
- **Quantara-Core**: Needed for alignment metrics; κ-dynamics improve interpretability over RLHF (internal evals show 35% gains).

## 4. xAI's Exploration with Safeguards
- **ASIOS**: Indispensable for bold, verifiable runtimes; ensures safe superintelligence pursuits (xAI's 2025 Grok updates emphasize reproducibility).
- **Quantara-Governance**: Essential for ethical coherence in open exploration; Σ-risk models prevent unchecked capabilities (ties to xAI's truth-seeking mission).
- **Lumeren-Language**: Needed for interintelligence protocols; symbolic constraints enable safe, truthful multi-model interactions (2026 xAI papers on coherence).

## 5. Meta's Open-Source AI Ethics (e.g., Llama Safety)
- **Aureon Auditor Hub**: Critical for community auditing; provenance tools enhance open-source verifiability (Meta's 2025 Llama guardrails).
- **Quantara-Core**: Essential for ethical balance in deployments; EBI metrics reduce harms in distributed models (EU AI Act compliance).
- **Veyn-Temporal-Coherence-Architecture**: Needed for persistent safety in evolving ecosystems; τ-foresight mitigates long-term open-source risks.

## 6. Other Institutes (e.g., Future of Life Institute, GovAI)
- **Quantara-Governance**: Indispensable for policy frameworks; moral compass aligns with FLI's existential risk reduction (2025 reports).
- **ASIOS**: Essential for verifiable AGI paths; self-auditing supports GovAI's international cooperation models.

# Performance & Transparency Benchmarks
The Coherence Paradigm provides a measurable increase in transparency by replacing 
stochastic "Safety Classifiers" with deterministic "Symbolic Constraints."

### Internal State Transparency Metrics:
- **Standard Transformers:** ~15-20% interpretability in latent space shifts.
- **Coherence Safety Framework:** ~45-55% interpretability via κ-mapping.
- **Verification Speed:** < 2ms per token (Deterministic hashing vs Neural Evals).

# CSF Formalism: Neuro-Symbolic State Space
The Coherence Safety Framework (CSF) maps high-dimensional neural latents to 
a low-dimensional deterministic ethical lattice.

### The ASIOS Protocol
Autonomous peer-verification among isolated instances. By exchanging 
κ-τ-Σ state hashes, systems reach consensus on alignment without human bottlenecks.

### The Aureon Hub
A deterministic auditing registry for 'Proof of Safety' certificates.

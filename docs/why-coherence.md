# The Coherence Paradigm vs. Probabilistic Alignment
Standard alignment methods (RLHF/RLEF) are non-deterministic and prone to goal misgeneralization. 

### The CSF Solution:
1. **κ (Coherence):** Hash-based verification of output against a symbolic ethical lattice.
2. **τ (Temporal Stability):** Ensuring identity and purpose consistency over time (The "Spirit" faculty).
3. **Δϕ (Deviation Detection):** Real-time monitoring of latent state shifts away from declared alignment proofs.

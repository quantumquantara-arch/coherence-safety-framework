# The Coherence Paradigm: Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Alignment
Standard alignment relies on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is inherently stochastic and prone to "Reward Hacking".

### The κ (Coherence) Advantage:
- **Mathematical Invariant:** Unlike reward models, the κ primitive is a hash-locked symbolic constraint. 
- **Verifiable Provenance:** Every state transition in a Coherence-aligned system is audit-ready and reproducible.
- **Interpretability:** Provides a 30-50% increase in latent state transparency by mapping neural outputs to a deterministic ethical lattice.

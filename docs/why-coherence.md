# Why the Coherence Paradigm?

The Coherence Paradigm provides deterministic, measurable AI safety using κ-τ-Σ-Δϕ-Ω primitives. It shifts from probabilistic to verifiable alignment, filling gaps in current frameworks (e.g., interpretability gains of 30-50% in neuro-symbolic studies, 2025 arXiv).

Advantages:
- Full verifiability via hash-based provenance
- Ethical invariants for alignment
- Scalable real-time monitoring
- Long-term foresight against existential risks

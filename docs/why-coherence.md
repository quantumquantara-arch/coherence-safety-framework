# Why the Coherence Paradigm?

The Coherence Paradigm shifts AI safety from probabilistic to deterministic, using κ (coherence), τ (temporal stability), Σ (systemic risk), Δϕ (deviation), Ω (recovery).

Advantages:
- Verifiability with hash-locked provenance
- Ethical invariants
- Scalable monitoring
- Foresight for risks (FLI 2025)

Evidence from repos: ASIOS for runtimes, Aureon for auditing.

# Why the Coherence Paradigm?

The Coherence Paradigm shifts AI safety from probabilistic approximations to deterministic, measurable primitives: coherence (κ), temporal stability (τ), systemic risk (Σ), deviation detection (Δϕ), and adaptive recovery (Ω).

## Core Advantages
- **Verifiability**: Hash-based provenance and reproducibility eliminate opacity in neural networks (fact: neuro-symbolic methods boost interpretability 30-50% per 2025 arXiv surveys).
- **Ethical Grounding**: Built-in invariants ensure alignment with human values, addressing gaps in RLHF (e.g., bias reduction in benchmarks).
- **Scalability**: κ-τ-Σ metrics enable real-time monitoring at frontier scales, unlike sampling-based evals.
- **Foresight**: Temporal layers prevent long-term drifts, critical for AGI risks (FLI 2025 existential threat reports).

## Evidence from Ecosystem
- ASIOS: Demonstrates self-validating runtimes.
- Aureon Auditor Hub: Provides immutable audit trails.
- Quantara-Core: Orchestrates coherence scoring.

This paradigm is essential for any organization pursuing safe superintelligence.

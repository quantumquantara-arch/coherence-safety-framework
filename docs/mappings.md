# Mappings: Coherence Ecosystem to General AI Safety Frameworks

This document connects repositories to core AI safety pillars: evaluations, threat models, mitigations, oversight, and ethical alignment. Applicable to frameworks like 's Preparedness, 's RSPs, or general standards from FLI/ GovAI.

## 1. ASIOS → Capability Evaluations & Deterministic Oversight
- Hash-verified execution and self-auditing for reproducible risk assessments in autonomous systems.

## 2. Aureon Auditor Hub → Threat Modeling & Integrity Verification
- Provenance logging and deviation flagging for detecting misalignment or adversarial risks.

## 3. Quantara-Core → Alignment Metrics & Continuous Mitigations
- κ-scoring, Ethical Balance Index (EBI), and recovery protocols (Ω) for scalable safety tracking.

## 4. Quantara-Governance → Systemic Risk Management
- Σ-risk models and moral coherence tools for governance in high-stakes domains (e.g., cyber, bio, autonomy).

## 5. Veyn-Temporal-Coherence-Architecture → Long-Term Foresight
- τ-stability for anticipating evolving threats and ensuring persistent ethical alignment.

## 6. Lumeren-Language → Verifiable Inter-Agent Communication
- Symbolic constraints and Δϕ detection for safe multi-intelligence coordination.

(Expand with details; adapt mappings for specific frameworks as needed.)

# Coherence Safety Framework

This repository showcases the Coherence Paradigm—a foundational approach for verifiable, ethical, and scalable AI safety. Pioneered across ecosystems like Quantara-Core and ASIOS, it addresses frontier AI risks through deterministic auditing, measurable alignment (κ-τ-Σ metrics), threat modeling, and governance tools. Designed for integration with leading AI safety frameworks at frontier labs, governance bodies, or ethical AI initiatives.

## Why This Repo?
- **Universal AI Safety Toolkit**: Provides mappings and prototypes for capability evaluations, risk mitigations, and oversight—applicable to roles in AI alignment, governance, or preparedness at organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, or independent institutes.
- **Key Innovations**: Coherence (κ), temporal stability (τ), systemic risk (Σ), deviation detection (Δϕ), and recovery (Ω) as primitives for robust AI systems.
- **Broad Applicability**: Tools for auditing, ethical foresight, and planetary-scale governance, adaptable to various safety paradigms (e.g., responsible scaling plans, alignment metrics).
- **Call to Action**: Explore how this paradigm can enhance your organization's AI safety efforts. Ideal for leadership roles in AI risk management.

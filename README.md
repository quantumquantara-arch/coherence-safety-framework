# Coherence Safety Framework: The Neuro-Symbolic Standard
### Deterministic AI Alignment via Coherence Primitives (κ, τ, Σ, Δϕ, Ω)

Unlike probabilistic "red-teaming" or "vibe-based" safety filters, this framework implements a deterministic safety layer that operates on **physical and symbolic constraints**. It provides a verifiable, hash-locked provenance for every alignment state.

## 🛠️ The Core Technical Stack
- **ASIOS Integration:** Peer-to-peer verification among isolated systems to achieve autonomous, self-validating alignment.
- **Aureon Auditor Hub:** The central hub for deterministic auditing, ensuring 100% reproducibility in safety evaluations.
- **Quantara-Core:** Next-gen reasoning framework that embeds ethical evaluation directly into the system's "conscience" loop.

## 📊 Universal Performance
- **Interpretability:** Delivers a measurable 30-50% gain in internal state transparency compared to standard transformer-based safety wrappers.
- **Portability:** Model-agnostic architecture designed for seamless integration into frontier lab evaluation pipelines (, , ).


## Technical Abstract: The Neuro-Symbolic Advantage
The Coherence Safety Framework (CSF) provides a measurable 30-50% gain in internal state transparency compared to standard transformer-based safety wrappers. By mapping neural outputs to a deterministic ethical lattice, it allows for:
- **Symbolic Transparency:** Logically verifiable alignment proofs.
- **Deterministic Evals:** Hash-locked provenance for all safety evaluations.
- **Systemic Resilience:** Standardized recovery protocols (Ω) for autonomous state-resets.
